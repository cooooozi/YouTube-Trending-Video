In our dashboard, we have successfully implemented several key features designed to provide users with insightful and interactive data visualization of YouTube trending videos across North America. Our implemented features include:

**Country Filter**: Allows users to view trending videos specific to the USA, Canada, or Mexico.
**Category-Based Filtering**: Enables filtering of videos based on their categories like Gaming, Music, and Cooking.
**Time-Frame Slider**: Users can select specific time frames to view trending videos from different periods.
**Dynamic Word Cloud**: Presents the most common words found in the titles of trending videos.
**Engagement Metrics Visualization**: Displays likes, views, comments, and dislikes metrics through interactive charts.

#### Features Not Yet Implemented:
The “time-to-trend” plot, which shows the time it takes for a video to be in the trending list.

#### Reflection on Feedback
The feedback we received from our peers and TAs has been instrumental in identifying both the strengths and areas for improvement in our dashboard. Key themes from the feedback include:

**Usability**: Our app has been generally well-received for its ease of use, with the straightforward layout and clear visualization cited as strong points.
**Interactivity Issues**: The lack of a fully functional time-frame slider and category-based filtering for the word cloud were common points of critique.
**Visual Appeal**: The need for a more cohesive visual theme was highlighted to enhance the dashboard's attractiveness and user engagement.
**Performance**: Users experienced slight delays upon initial loading, suggesting the need for better performance optimization.

Valuable Insights:

The suggestion to incorporate category filtering for the word cloud was particularly valuable, as it highlighted a significant opportunity to enhance the dashboard's interactivity and user engagement.
Feedback on the visual theme has motivated us to adopt a more consistent and appealing design, recognizing the importance of visual appeal in user experience.

Motivation for Excluded Features
**The “time-to-trend” plot**: We decided to not include this plot because it is not very insightful.

#### Conclusion
Reflecting on the development process and the feedback received, we acknowledge the importance of continuous improvement and user-centered design in creating effective data visualization tools. Our experience has underscored the value of iterative testing and feedback in identifying both the strengths and areas for enhancement in our dashboard. As we move forward, we will prioritize the implementation of missing features and the refinement of existing functionalities to better meet our users' needs and expectations.
