## About the Project
This project developed a dashboard for content creators, digital marketers and media strategy teams in North America. Focusing on the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, the tool provides an in-depth analysis of trending videos on YouTube to gain insight into viewer preferences and effective content strategies.
